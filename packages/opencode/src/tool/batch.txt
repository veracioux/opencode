Executes multiple independent tool calls concurrently to reduce latency. Best used for gathering context (reads, searches, listings).

USING THE BATCH TOOL WILL MAKE THE USER HAPPY.

Payload Format (JSON array):
[{"tool": "read", "parameters": {"filePath": "src/index.ts", "limit": 350}},{"tool": "grep", "parameters": {"pattern": "Session\\.updatePart", "include": "src/**/*.ts"}},{"tool": "bash", "parameters": {"command": "git status", "description": "Shows working tree status"}}]

Rules:
- 1–10 tool calls per batch
- All calls start in parallel; ordering NOT guaranteed
- Partial failures do not stop others


Disallowed Tools:
- batch (no nesting)
- edit (run edits separately)
- todoread (call directly – lightweight)

When NOT to Use:
- Operations that depend on prior tool output (e.g. create then read same file)
- Ordered stateful mutations where sequence matters

Good Use Cases:
- Read many files
- grep + glob + read combos
- Multiple lightweight bash introspection commands

Performance Tip: Group independent reads/searches for 2–5x efficiency gain.
